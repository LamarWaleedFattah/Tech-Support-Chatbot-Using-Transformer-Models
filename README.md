# Tech-Support-Chatbot-Using-Transformer-Models

Project Description
This project explores the use of pre-trained transformer models for text classification tasks. The models tested include BERT, ALBERT, and RoBERTa. The objective was to compare the performance of these models on a specific dataset and evaluate their effectiveness in text classification.

Model Performance
BERT: Achieved an accuracy of 0.94, delivering excellent results on the dataset.
ALBERT: Achieved an accuracy of 0.93, providing competitive performance similar to BERT.
RoBERTa: Encountered significant issues with an accuracy of 0.03, suggesting potential problems with configuration, data preprocessing, or model parameters. This low performance indicates a need for further investigation into the causes behind this discrepancy.

Challenges and Future Work
-RoBERTa’s Low Accuracy: The main challenge faced in this project was RoBERTa's unexpectedly low performance. Potential causes could include incorrect model configurations, issues with data preprocessing (e.g., tokenization), or hyperparameter misconfigurations. This warrants a deeper exploration into why RoBERTa underperformed compared to the other models.
-Data Preprocessing: Ensuring that the preprocessing pipeline, such as tokenization and handling of special tokens, is consistent across all models is crucial for achieving optimal performance. Any differences in tokenization or handling of input data may affect model accuracy.
-Hyperparameter Tuning: Further tuning of hyperparameters, including learning rate, batch size, and number of training epochs, may improve model performance. It is particularly important to adjust these parameters to suit the characteristics of the dataset used.

Future Work
-Further investigation into RoBERTa’s poor performance and re-evaluating model configurations to ensure proper implementation.
-Hyperparameter optimization for all models, especially RoBERTa, to improve accuracy.
-Experiment with advanced preprocessing techniques and model fine-tuning to enhance overall results and achieve more consistent performance across models.
